This examples database contains examples that are briefly discussed in the [mars docs]() as well as some example scripts for functions also accessible through the user interfaces.

### Discussed Example Scripts
[1. Plot the Kinetic Change Point Rates with Python](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_scripts_and_notebooks/KCP_widget_and_jupyter_plot.ipynb)  
Jupyter notebook showing how to retrieve the segment tables in a Python environment and how to plot the calculated rates with seaborn as well as in the **Rover** scriptable widgets.

[2. Generate a Table of Parameter Values from the Archive](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_scripts_and_notebooks/Generate_a_table_of_parameter_values.groovy)  
Groovy script to make a MarsTable showing the value for the specified parameter for each molecule entry.

[3. Plot the Tracking Results as Color Corded Overlay in the Image]()  
Script to show the tracking results in the MoleculeArchive as color coded ROIs on the original video. Also possible to show the overlay for tagged molecules only.
