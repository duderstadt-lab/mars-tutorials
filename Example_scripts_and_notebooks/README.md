This examples database contains examples that are briefly discussed in the [mars docs]() as well as some example scripts for functions also accessible through the user interfaces.

### Discussed Example Scripts
[1. Plot the Kinetic Change Point Rates with Python](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_scripts_and_notebooks/KCP_widget_and_jupyter_plot.ipynb)  
Jupyter notebook showing how to retrieve the segment tables in a Python environment and how to plot the calculated rates with seaborn as well as in the **Rover** scriptable widgets.

[2. Generate a Table of Parameter Values from the Archive](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_scripts_and_notebooks/Generate_a_table_of_parameter_values.groovy)  
Groovy script to make a MarsTable showing the value for the specified parameter for each molecule entry. Run the script and a pop-up dialog will be created in which the parameter of interest can be selected.

[3. Plot the Tracking Results as Color Coded Overlay in the Image](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_scripts_and_notebooks/Color_coded_tracks_overlay)  
Script to show the tracking results in the MoleculeArchive as color coded ROIs on the original video. Also possible to show the overlay for tagged molecules only.

8. Convert from Pixels to Length
9. Filter Molecules by Parameter Values
10. Calculate the Slope between Start and End
11. Get Number of Molecules with Tags
12. Get the Intensity for the First Frame for all Molecules
13. Color Coded Track Overlay for Tagged Molecules
