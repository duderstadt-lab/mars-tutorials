READ ME - Analyze all data in the FRET example

Due to intensity differences in the videos provided by Hellenkamp et al,
different mars command settings need to be used. Follow the instructions
below to fully analyze the dataset in a correct way.

1. Convert all videos to the right format as discussed on the docs.

2. Generate the FRET, AO, and DO archive from each video as shown for the
example on the docs. https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/examples/FRET/
For some videos the raw intensities differ a little. Adjust detection thresholds accordingly.

3. Use the affine2D matrix as calculated on the docs

4. For each video, generate the FRET, AO, and DO archives according to the
information on the docs.

5. Merge the archives so each video has a master archive containing the
FRET, AO, and DO information.

6. Merge the archives in the following way:
  - 1-lo video 0 to 4
  - 1-lo video 5 & 6
  - 1-mid video 0 to 6
This will give you three master archives to continue the analysis with.

8. Merge the fully analyzed archives into one big archive.

9. Run the full analysis script on the merged archive.

10. Save the result. Open jupyter notebook, set up the connection as described
on the docs and run all cells. The final cell will supply the desired plot.
